# Overview

Welcome to Priyanka’s Technical Writing Portfolio — a collection of documentation projects, user guides, and articles that demonstrate my ability to communicate complex technical topics with clarity, accuracy and creativity.  

I’m passionate about making technology accessible — turning intricate setups, workflows and software tools into content that helps users learn, build and troubleshoot with confidence.

Each document focuses on:

1. Clarity – Simple, reader-friendly explanations.

2. Technical Accuracy – Verified steps and details.

## About This Portfolio

This site is built using MkDocs with the Material theme, written entirely in Markdown and hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It’s a living showcase — I continuously add new samples as I explore advanced documentation systems like DITA, FrameMaker and Sphinx.

My goal as a technical writer is to bridge the gap between technology and understanding, creating documentation that’s not only accurate but enjoyable to read.
