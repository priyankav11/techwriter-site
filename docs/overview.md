This site is built using MkDocs with the Material theme, written entirely in Markdown and hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It’s a living showcase — I continuously add new samples as I explore advanced documentation systems like DITA, FrameMaker and Sphinx.

My goal as a technical writer is to bridge the gap between technology and understanding, creating documentation that’s not only accurate but enjoyable to read.
