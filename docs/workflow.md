#  My Documentation Workflow (DDLC + MSTP)

I follow the **Documentation Development Life Cycle (DDLC)** to ensure every document I create is clear, accurate, and consistent with the product’s evolution.

| **Phase**       | **What I Do** |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Analysis**     | Identify audience and purpose; gather information from developers, SMEs, or existing product documentation. |
| **Design**       | Outline structure, decide on tone, and format following **MSTP (Microsoft Style Guide)** principles. |
| **Development**  | Write content in Markdown, Confluence, or Oxygen using **plain language, active voice,** and consistent terminology. |
| **Review & Edit**| Perform technical and editorial reviews — check for clarity, flow, and MSTP adherence. |
| **Publish**      | Push final version to **GitHub Pages, MkDocs, or Confluence** for visibility. |
| **Maintain**     | Update docs as the product evolves or based on user feedback. |

##  Microsoft Style Guide (MSTP) Principles I Follow

-  Use **active voice** and **simple sentence structures**.  
-  Prefer **“select”** over “click,” and **“enter”** over “type.”  
-  Maintain **consistent capitalization, UI formatting, and list styles.**  
-  Avoid unnecessary jargon — focus on clarity and empathy for the reader.  
-  Keep structure uniform across documents (titles, steps, references).
